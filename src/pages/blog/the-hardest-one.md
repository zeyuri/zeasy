A lot of things in my life were only exciting in the beginning... when the mood is still high, enthusiasm up there, _unless is about writing a blog_. Although my whole life I never felt without words, writing here is hard. Specially, in a place that is mine and mine alone. The words never came.

It wasn't for a lack of trying. There were several attempts to find words and subjects to express here. I threw thoughts at life hoping to find what is most precious, _the meaning_.

Unfortunately I've never had much success, I can't find much sense and reasons to write, but now I have no excuses, let's write even in the absence of meaning.
